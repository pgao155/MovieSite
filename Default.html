                <h2>Written By: Peng Gao</h2>
                <p>Welcome <span class="user"></span> to a analytics application taking a look at some of the movies
                that have been released in the last two years.</p>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <p><span class="user"></span>, this pie chart shows the percentage of the genre of the movies analyzed. When
                        you mouse over a section of the pie chart, the center will update and show you the number of movies in that
                        genre and the percentage of the total that the genre makes up. You can also click and add sections of the pie together.</p>
                        <p>This chart was a lot of fun and one of the charts that I spent the most time on. I must have spent a week looking over
                        fiddles and codepen examples until I was able to get an understanding of how this works.</p>

                        <span>Budget vs IMDB Score</span>
                        <div id="budgetIMDBInfo" style="float:right" data-tooltip>
                            <img src="Imgs/info.png" style="height:24px;margin-top:-7px;" />

                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <p><span class="user"></span>! This graph is pretty neat. The x axis is the budget for the movie and the y axis
                        is the resulting IMDB score. As you can see, if we drew a best fit line, the higher the budget, the higher
                        the resulting IMDB score. If you mouse over the graph a dtop will follow the x mouse position but will stay on the path of the line!
                        I was going to take this a step further, but d3 is quite complicated. I wanted to have a tooltip pop up for each point of data
                        that is moused over. Maybe next year!</p>

                        <p>So <span class="user"></span>, this graph was the hardest one that I worked on. You would think drawing bars is easy, but when
                        the application doesnt know how many bars are going to be plotted, how can it determine the width of each bar? And how can it know what the proper 
                        ranges are for the domain and range. This was a challenge, but the basis of the chart is here.</p>
                        <p>The x axis represents the budget for the movies while the y axis shows the gross income of the movie.</p>
